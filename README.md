Continuous integration with Jenkins


## What Is Jenkins
Put simply, Jenkins is an open source automation server
Jenkins is used to build and test software projects continuously, this makes it easier for developers to integrate code
as changes are made through small incremental steps
If any errors are found when Jenkins tries to build our project, the build will fail and the developer would be
altered immediately
If the build is successful, the project can be placed in the Delivery Phase

As default Jenkins comes with limited features however it has over 1000 plugins, version controls such as git as well
as integration tools like Maven must be installed to use

### Beneftis
- Easy to detect bugs as tests are run after each commit
- Automated testing and building means more time can be spent on improving the software quality
- Automated processes also mean companies can be more reactive to customer feedback, increase customer satisfaction

![Jenkins Deploy](images/jenkins-build-test-deploy.png)

- Developer commits to the shared repository
- Jenkins detects the changes and pulls the code to prepare a build
- If the build fails, the developer would be notified
- If the build is successful, Jenkins will deploy the test server
- Providing the tests pass, the application can be moved to the deployment stage, if not the developer is sent feedback
- Jenkins server continues to check the shared repo for changes
